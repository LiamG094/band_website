<h1>🎸🐍Cottonmouth band website🎸🐍</h1>
<h2>throwing together a website for my band to use as a project to practice and improve my website design skills</h2>

<h3>Upon uploading it has the basics to build on:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Header</li>
  <li>Navigation links to each page and home page link on the title</li>
  <li>Social media links from https://fontawesome.com/icons/packs/brands</li>
  <li>footer</li>
</ul>

<h3>The plan is to build on the features, add our own preferred styling and some content from gigs</h3>
